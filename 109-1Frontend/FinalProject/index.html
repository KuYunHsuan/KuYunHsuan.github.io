            what I wanna do: to build a own schuduler that only I can view and edit.
            which should contain the function below to make sure this works for me.
            1. a special viewing mode that show one task at once
            2. set a deadline
            3. send notification to my phone (either via mail or smthing else)
            4. theme change, since people like to look differenct, lol.
